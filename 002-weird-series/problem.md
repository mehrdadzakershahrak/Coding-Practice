# Problem

Given `A`, `B`, `n` calculate the first `n` numbers of the following series:

The increasing sequence of numbers generated by `A * x + B * y`  for `x`, `y`
in `0, 1, 2, ...` knowing that A and B are integer constants with the following
properties:

- `1 < A < B` and
- `A` and `B` are co-prime numbers

### Example

For `A = 5` and `B = 7`, the first 10 numbers of the series are:

`0, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20`


# Testing

The input contains 3 numbers, `A`, `B` and `n`. Print the first `n` numbers of
the series each on a separate line
