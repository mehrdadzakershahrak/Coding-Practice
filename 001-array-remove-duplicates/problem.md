# Problem

Given an array of integers, remove duplicate entries while preserving the order
of the elements. The first occurrence of each number must be preserved, for
example, given the array 1 1 2 3 1, the output must be 1 2 3 and not 2 3 1.

# Testing

The input is given in the following format:

- The number of elements n is given on the first line
- Second line contains n space-separated integers

The output should be one line of space-separated integers terminated with '\n'
